#| Exercise 423.
Define partition. It consumes a String s and a natural number n.
The function produces a list of string chunks of size n.

For non-empty strings s and positive natural numbers n,
(equal? (partition s n) (bundle (explode s) n))

is #true. But donâ€™t use this equality as the definition for partition; use substring instead.
Hint Have partition produce its natural result for the empty string.
For the case where n is 0, see exercise 421.

Note The partition function is somewhat closer to
what a cooperative DrRacket environment would need than bundle.
