#| Exercise 510.
Many operating systems come with the fmt program,
which can rearrange the words in a file so that
all lines in the resulting file have a maximal width.
As a widely used program, fmt supports a range of related functions.
This exercise focuses on its core functionality.

Design the program fmt. It consumes a natural number w,
the name of an input file in-f, and the name of an output file out-fâ€”in
the same sense as read-file from the 2htdp/batch-io teachpack.
Its purpose is to read all the words from the in-f,
to arrange these words in the given order into lines of maximal width w,
and to write these lines to out-f. |#

; (read-words "Ex-510-data.txt")

; N String String -> String
; read content from in-f, recombine the words in in-f
; into lines that have max length w.
; finally write the result into out-f
(define (fmt w in-f out-f)
  (write-file out-f (foldl (lambda (cur prev) (string-append prev cur "\n"))
                           ""
                           (map (lambda (l) (foldl (lambda (cur prev) (string-append prev cur " ")) "" l))
                                (fmt-core (read-words in-f) w)))))

; which the total symbol count on every item in it  is less than w
